    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a delicious blueberry pie recipe made Sally McKenney at <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-blueberry-pie/">Sally's Baking Addiction</a>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Homemade Pie Crust or All Butter Pie Crust</li>
            <li>6 cups fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>optional: coarse sugar for sprinkling on crust</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare either pie crust recipe through step 5.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir together blueberries, sugar, flour, cornstarch, and cinnamon. Mix until no longer dry—burst a few blueberries if needed to moisten. Set aside while oven preheats. (Filling can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)</li>
            <li>Adjust rack to the lower third and preheat to 425°F (218°C). Place a baking sheet on the bottom rack to catch any drips.</li>
            <li>On a floured surface, roll out one disc of dough into a 12-inch circle. Place in a 9 x 1.5 or 2-inch pie dish and smooth it in. Add filling and dot with small pieces of butter. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Roll out second disc of dough into a 12-inch circle. Cut into strips and weave a lattice over the pie. Press edges to seal, trim excess dough, and crimp or flute the edges.</li>
            <li>Brush top and edges with egg wash. Sprinkle with coarse sugar, if using.</li>
            <li>Bake at 425°F for 25 minutes, then reduce to 375°F (190°C) and bake 40–50 minutes more, until the filling bubbles in the center and reaches ~200°F (93°C). Use a crust shield to prevent over-browning. Tent with foil if top browns too quickly.</li>
            <li>Cool on a rack for at least 4 hours before slicing. Store leftovers tightly covered in the fridge for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
